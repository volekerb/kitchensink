# Challenges & Lessons Learned

---

### Technical Challenges

**1. CDI to Spring DI Migration**
- JBoss CDI and Spring DI have conceptual similarities but different implementations
- Challenges in mapping producer methods to Spring components
- Solution: Refactored to use constructor injection and component scanning

**2. Transaction Management**
- JBoss EJBs provide container-managed transactions
- Spring uses declarative transactions with `@Transactional`
- Challenge: Ensuring proper transaction boundaries
- Solution: Applied `@Transactional` at service level with appropriate propagation

**3. Event System Differences**
- JBoss CDI events vs Spring's event publisher
- Challenge: Maintaining the same event-driven architecture
- Solution: Created custom event classes and used Spring's `ApplicationEventPublisher`

### Technical Challenges (cont.)

**4. UI Framework Migration**
- Moving from JSF to Thymeleaf required complete UI rewrite
- Challenge: Maintaining validation and error handling
- Solution: Leveraged Spring MVC's form binding and validation

**5. MongoDB Integration**
- Supporting both relational and document databases
- Challenge: Maintaining consistent API across both implementations
- Solution: Used profiles, conditional beans, and interface-based design

**6. Testing Strategy**
- JBoss Arquillian vs Spring Boot Test
- Challenge: Ensuring equivalent test coverage
- Solution: Comprehensive unit and integration tests with Spring Boot Test

### Lessons Learned

**1. Incremental Migration Works**
- Breaking down the migration into manageable components was effective
- Each layer could be migrated and tested independently
- Allowed for continuous progress tracking

**2. Documentation is Crucial**
- Documenting design decisions and migration steps was invaluable
- Helped identify potential issues before implementation
- Created a roadmap for future migrations

**3. Abstraction Pays Off**
- Interface-based design made database flexibility possible
- Clean separation of concerns simplified testing
- Made the codebase more maintainable

### Lessons Learned (cont.)

**4. Modern Infrastructure is Worth the Effort**
- Docker and Kubernetes deployment simplified operations
- Configuration as code improved reproducibility
- Multiple deployment options increased flexibility

**5. Test-Driven Migration Reduces Risk**
- Writing tests before migration helped ensure functionality
- Integration tests verified end-to-end flows
- Reduced regression risks

**6. Spring Boot Reduces Boilerplate**
- Auto-configuration simplified setup
- Less configuration code compared to JBoss
- More focus on business logic, less on infrastructure

### Recommendations for Large-Scale Migrations

**1. Start with a Proof of Concept**
- Migrate a small, representative component first
- Validate approach before full commitment
- Identify potential issues early

**2. Establish Clear Migration Patterns**
- Document common migration patterns
- Create reusable templates and utilities
- Ensure consistency across the codebase

**3. Implement Feature Flags**
- Allow gradual rollout of migrated components
- Enable easy rollback if issues arise
- Support A/B testing of old vs. new implementations

**4. Invest in Automated Testing**
- Comprehensive test suite is essential
- Automated integration tests validate end-to-end flows
- CI/CD pipeline ensures quality throughout migration
