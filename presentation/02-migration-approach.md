# Migration Approach & Strategy

---

### Structured Migration Plan

1. Initial project setup and analysis
2. Core infrastructure migration
3. Business logic migration
4. Presentation layer migration
5. Testing and verification
6. Documentation and deployment
7. MongoDB integration (stretch goal)

---

### Breaking Down the Problem

- **Analyze the existing application**
  - Understand component relationships
  - Identify JBoss-specific features
  - Map to Spring Boot equivalents

- **Layer-by-layer migration**
  - Start with domain model and data access
  - Move to business logic
  - Finish with presentation layer

---

### Guiding Principles

- **Incremental Development**
  - One component at a time
  - Ensure each component works before moving on
  - Regular commits with clear messages

- **Continuous Testing**
  - Write tests alongside code
  - Ensure test coverage for critical paths
  - Both unit and integration tests

---

### Guiding Principles (cont.)

- **Separation of Concerns**
  - Clear layer separation
  - Interface-based contracts
  - SOLID principles

- **Documentation-First Approach**
  - Document design decisions
  - Keep README updated
  - Document deviations from original

- **Technology Modernization**
  - Java 21 features
  - Spring Boot auto-configuration
  - Modern security practices

---

### Scaling to Larger Applications

- **Modular approach enables parallel work**
  - Teams can work on different layers simultaneously
  - Clear interfaces between components

- **Comprehensive testing ensures quality**
  - Unit tests for individual components
  - Integration tests for end-to-end flows

- **Documentation facilitates knowledge transfer**
  - New team members can quickly understand the codebase
  - Clear migration patterns can be reused
